This project is no longer maintained. Debian installer now uses secure boot which requires signing with an official Debian key. So it is no longer possible to modify the installer.

# Unofficial Debian-installer-with-serial-console
Builds an unofficial Debian Strech installer with serial console enabled by default on /dev/ttyS0, speed 115200. No need to type "H" during boot or to modify Grub loader. Compatible with a vast number of computers, from PC Engines APU/ALIX to Supermicro computers. Build your own installer or download one. Available for x86, x64 and soon arm. 

Debian-serial-console is a wrapper around build-simple-cdd scrpit and Debian preseed configuration.

Before installing, you may read Debian installer documentation:
https://d-i.debian.org/manual/en.i386/apa.html

WARNING:
This project is NOT an official Debian installer and is NOT supported by the Debian community. It allows to build a generic Debian GNU/Linux installer with serial console enabled by default. It is yet an experimental tool meant to study inclusion in Debian of an installer with full serial-console support. Use with caution at your own risk.

Using the Official Debian installer for a serial console installation is still possible:
* Follow Debian guidelines to make a CD or USB key, and press "H" on boot to access help.
* Press F10 or F12 hoping this does not interfere with your running environment.
* Upon reboot, you will need to modify /etc/defaut/grub to enable serial console. 

If the Debian official installer does not suit you, please use our script to create an unofficial Debian installer with serial console:

# Supported computers
No need for a complex BIOS or IPMI to have serial console redirection. Your computer ONLY needs a serial port. This is the case of most servers and small appliances, like the Pc Engines APU 1/2/3 series and Alix series.

This installer has been tested on:
* Pc Engines APU 1c (USB stick / CD-ROM / TFT boot)
* Supermicro server (USB stick / CD-ROM / TFT boot)

This unofficial installer is very minimal to support most needs.
It does not include custom packages, i.e. IPMI for Supermicro or LED support for Pc Engines APU.
After first boot, just install the required packages.

Please report success or questions opening a support issue on Github:
https://github.com/ffries/Debian-installer-with-serial-console/issues

# Serial console
By default, serial console is set to:
/dev/ttyS0 115200

Modify /profiles/serial-console.conf to enable an alternative serial port and/or speed.

# Debian architectures
Available in two architectures:
* amd64 (64 bit architecture)
* i386 (32 bit architecture)

Builds an amd64 installer by defaut. Modify /profiles/serial-console.conf to enable i386.
An unofficial installer for i386 can be build using an amd64 host and the converse is also true.

The i386 installer is slightly different and needs more testing.
Under ALIX 2D13, it is required to use i386 and a CD-ROM, as booting from USB stick is not supported.

# Debian flavors
Built for Debian latest release with security fixes:
Debian 9.1 (Stretch) 

# Firmwares
The installer includes free and non-free firmware allowing to detect network and wireless cards:
* firmware-atheros
* firmware-bnx2
* firmware-bnx2x
* firmware-brcm80211
* firmware-cavium
* firmware-intelwimax
* firmware-iwlwifi
* firmware-libertas
* firmware-linux
* firmware-misc-nonfree
* firmware-myricom
* firmware-netxen
* firmware-qlogic
* firmware-realtek
* firmware-ti-connectivity
* firmware-zd1211

# Running the script

Use a Debian Strech host for building. Building under Debian testing or Debian sid may result in an error.

Checkout the project:

	git clone https://github.com/ffries/Debian-installer-with-serial-console.git 

	cd Debian-installer-with-serial-console 

You may need to customize profiles/serial-console.conf

Then build the CD:

	sh ./build-debian-installer.sh

The resulting installer CD is in:
	images/debian-9.1-amd64-CD-1.iso

Burn a CD-ROM or transfer to a USB key.

# Screenshots

The installation under serial console is using only ASCII characters, and thus is very slylish and old-fashioned. Here are a few screenshots from the installer. Nothing new under the sun, as this is a plain Debian installer:

Reboot!

	The system is going to reboot.

WARNING: at present, it reboots on the installer. So remove the installation media as quickly as possible.

# Upon first boot

This is a very minimal installation. Make sure your are running Debian stable:

	$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list

	# deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 9.1 _Stretch_ - Unofficial amd64 CD Binary-1 20170809-07:45]/ stretch main non-free

	#deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 9.1 _Stretch_ - Unofficial amd64 CD Binary-1 20170809-07:45]/ stretch main non-free

	deb http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ stretch main non-free contrib
	deb-src http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ stretch main non-free contrib

	deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security stretch/updates main contrib non-free
	deb-src http://security.debian.org/debian-security stretch/updates main contrib non-free

	# stretch-updates, previously known as 'volatile'
	deb http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ stretch-updates main contrib non-free
	deb-src http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ stretch-updates main contrib non-free

Debian repositories should be the ones selected during installation. If you had network access during installation, it should be already up-to-date.

Now, please customize to your needs.

Reconfigure your locales:

	$ dpkg-reconfigure locales

Install OpenSSH server if you need SSH remote access:
	
	$ apt-get update
	$ apt-get install openssh-server

# Improvements/Issues

* Allow manual network configuration.
* Provide all locales like in a normal installer.
* Make sure that keyboard is well-detected. My keyboard is French. Can you verify with your own keyboard?
* Add more options to the script.
* Verify if Intel drivers can be added to the installer.
* Of course, a more suitable solution would be to modify Debian installer directly.
* Contact Debian team and discuss an official Debian installer with serial console, available from debian.org, with their own tools (stock installer).

# Credits
Credits go the GNU/linux Debian project, Debian installer and Debian simple-cdd tool. 
This project is also inspired by https://github.com/ssinyagin/pcengines-apu-debian-cd, which provides an automated installation for PC Engines APU.

# Future plans
Serial console is very common, from small embedded devices to large servers. No full-featured serial installer is available in Debian. On the converse, video mode is now set to VGA with graphics and Debian installer returns an error on serial console. Therefore, we would like to explore the idea of adding a serial console target in the main Gnu/Linux Debian installer. When this is done, we will remove this project.
